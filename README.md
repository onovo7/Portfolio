This is a duplicate checker. 
It allows you to compare two csv files with emails, regardless of the text format. 
If there duplicate emails, they will be saved as a separate csv file.
One of the use cases - is checking whether a list of addresses has been already contacted or still need to be contacted.

In order to test the application, there is an email list aggregator which generates email address list simulation.
